<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> Upon Graduation, I took various positions within the field of sales, despite my passion for Web-Development and programming.Most of my free time was spent working on mini web-development projects and trying to hone my skills so that I could eventually bring my ideas into action.I'd often ask myself why I was spending time in a field I disliked,and also took time away from doing things that I truly have a passion for. Since then I've been studying rigorously in hopes of securing a position as a web developer </p>
